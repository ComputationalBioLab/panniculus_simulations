# Panniculus carnosus work

This repository contains simulations of a simplified heel geometry under compression with and without the Panniculus carnosus. Key files are:

 * panniculus_simulations.py : the main FENICS simulation file to be run to gneerate the results
 * post_process.py : contains a script that process the csv files exported from Paraview
 * material_parameters.py : contains simple calculations and more ifnormation on the material parameters
